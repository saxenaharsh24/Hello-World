# Hi, I'm Harshvardhan
I am a final year mechanical engineering student at Nirma University. I am eager to secure challenging roles in mechanical engineering. I’m greatly interested in Aeronautics and Robotics. In the first year of my college I joined Team Arrow under SAE Nirma Collegiate Club. I was delighted to be presented with the opportunity to utilise the knowledge I had to design an UAV. In these three years I’ve gained many new skills like I’ve learnt Solidworks, Ansys, Xflr5, manufacturing of UAV and also I was the pilot of my team. Now, I'm assisting my team in designing the UAV for upcoming SAE aerodesign challenges by utilising these skills.
I enjoy learning new things regardless of where they come from.
